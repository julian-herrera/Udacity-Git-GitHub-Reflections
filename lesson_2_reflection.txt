What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

 - A new .git directory is created. It contains important repository files. Git uses that directory to manage the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

 - The staging area consists in files from the working directory that have been selected to be committed to the repository. It gives the developer finer control of what a commit will be.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

 - The staging area allows the developer to select just the files relevant to a logical change. Since only those files in the staging area are committed, then
 it can, and should use the staging area to commit single logical changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

 - When trying out some experimental feature. In this case the implementation would proceed in a new branch, leaving the master branch untouched.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

 - Commits form directed graphs, so it's only natural to represent them using diagrams. A Diagram is a very useful visual representation of a directed graph.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

 - Merging two branches together creates a new commit which combines the code from both branches. The new commit has the former tips of the branches as parents. That's why it is represented in the diagram as two paths colliding into one.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

 - Automatic merging saves a lot of work compared to manual merging, when it works. However, there is still the chance that Git wull introduce bugs in the merge. The pros of manually merging are that no bugs will be silently introduced and that the developer will always be aware of how the files changed. The cons are related to the increased work load associated with all that manual work, even when it's not really necessary.
